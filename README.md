<h1>Blog project to understand fullstack development</h1>
<p>To run the project:
<ul>
  <li>Download the project</li>
  <li>Run <code>npm install</code></li>
  <li>cd into the client folder and run <code>npm install</code></li>
  <li>In the root folder, run the following command: <code>npm run dev</code></li>
</ul></p>

<p>One of the main issues faced with this project was running localhost on Firefox or Chrome. This was because both the browsers give the following error:</p>
<h4>No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin'</h4>
<p>This issue was fixed using the commands provided in the following stack overflow page: <link>https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18310394/no-access-control-allow-origin-node-apache-port-issue</link></p>

<p>The server will run on localhost:3000 and the client will run on localhost:5173.</p>
